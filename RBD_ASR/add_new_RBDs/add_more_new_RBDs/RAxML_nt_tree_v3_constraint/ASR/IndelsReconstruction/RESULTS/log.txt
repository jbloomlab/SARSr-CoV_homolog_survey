 ---------------------- THE PARAMETERS ----------------------------
Likelihood computation is performed while acounting for un-oberved data
With min number of presences('1's)= 1
With min number of absences('0's)= 0
'Reversible'(Root.freq==stationary.freq) model is used
RootFreq EQ stationary (taken from each sp - gain/(gain+loss) )
